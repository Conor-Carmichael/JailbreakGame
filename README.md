# JailbreakGame

I have wanted to combine my programming and video game interests for a long time (the latter got me interested in the former). This game is my first attempt at that. 

## Idea
The concept of the game is simple, escape the room without being caught. The user plays to get a key that is being guarded by some enemies, and then needs to get to the door to escape. I have many ideas on making this more interesting, and this game will allow me to explore impmenting various game behaviours.
